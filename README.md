# Bug Tracker

This is a simple Bug Tracker app that uses the Context API and React hooks together to build a fully functional CRUD application that emulates a list of bugs within an IT software company. It will read existing bug data, create new bugs, update existing bugs, and delete bugs. To keep things simple with this app, I've hard-coded objects which will serve as the state.
